In this experiment we try to compare three implementations under 3 different situations.

The three implementations are:
- acc_mag: orientation is computed with accelerometer and magnetometer (update model).
- gyro: orientation is computed with a inertial model (prediction model).
- acc_mag_gyro: combining prediction and update models with a kalman filter.

The three situations are:
- slow 360° rotation
- fast 360° rotation
- shaking without rotation

For the shaking, the 3 implementations were running on the computer at the same time, but the the others were computed on the grisp one at a time.
