Quick circular motion (direction remains constant).

circle.m is a double integration assusming circular motion with
    constant centripetal acceleration.
kalman.m is modeling a linear motion with constant acceleration. Using data from
    bilateration and accelerometer.

sonar.csv: seqnum, range, timestamp(local)
NAV.csv: ax, ay, az

circle works fine,
kalman does not work.
